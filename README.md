# View Elm Documentation

This is a TypeScript/React app to view documentation for Elm 0.19 packages.

It's currently optimized to show the docs for Elmer, a test framework for Elm, but
it could be extended to show docs for any package. 

### Tests

Run the tests with 

```
$ npm test
```

### Build for production

```
$ npm run build
```
